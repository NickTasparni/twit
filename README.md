Have you ever seen a tweet that looks like this?

Chances are you have. This program (written entirely in python) finds and retweets these types of tweets. It also automatically favorites the tweet if the word "favorite"/"fav" is in it, and/or it will follow the user if the word "follow" is in the tweet.

# Screenshots
Here it is running. As you can see it found the word "follow" in a few tweets so it followed the user too.
Maybe it's just me but I think that's pretty cool.

Here is a picture of something it retweeted. It also followed this account (you don't see that though).

# Modules and code
It's compatible with all versions of Python, and the only modules it requires are 'time' (built-in) and tweepy.
You can install Tweepy with

    pip install tweepy

The github repo for it is [here](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy).

Also -- you can get all the keys/tokens if you follow [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-authenticate-a-python-application-with-twitter-using-tweepy-on-ubuntu-14-04) guide.
 
# Progress
I just looked at the last 20 things it has retweeted, and it retweeted 18 'good' tweets, and only 2 'bad' ones. A 'good' tweet is one that is a "Retweet for a chance to win"-type tweet, while a 'bad' tweet is a tweet that isn't a contest. I'd say that 90% valid retweets is pretty great.

# Terms of use
Feel free to do whatever with it, but if you get in trouble with Twitter you'd better not get me in trouble too.
